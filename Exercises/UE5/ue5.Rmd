## transform
First we get the average rating for each movie
```{r}


```

```{r}


```





## Join

Let's try out some join functions and see how they work on our two datasets
```{r}


```
```{r}


```

```{r}

## Analytics of our data

Which of the movies from High School Musical or Camp Rock has the best ratings?


```{r}


```

Let's get a selection of the best rated movies. We apply a filter to all movies that hit more than 100 ratings
```{r}


```


Finally, we want to explore some bind functions
```{r}
